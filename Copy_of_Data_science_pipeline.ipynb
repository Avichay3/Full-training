        "\n",
        "A **Data science mission** involves building a system that learns from data to make predictions or discover patterns. The process begins by defining the problem, gathering and preparing the necessary data, choosing and training models, and finally deploying the model for real-world use. Each step ensures the model is optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability.\n",

        "### Key Steps in an Data science Mission:\n",
        "- **Define the problem**: Identify the goal (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).\n",
        "- **Collect data**: Gather relevant data for the task.\n",
        "- **Data preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and prepare the data.\n",
        "- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
        "- **Feature engineering**: Create or modify features to improve model performance.\n",
        "- **Model selection**: Choose appropriate algorithms for the problem.\n",
        "- **Model training**: Train the model using the training data.\n",
        "- **Validation**: Validate model performance and tune hyperparameters.\n",
        "- **Evaluation**: Test the model using appropriate metrics.\n",
        "- **Deployment**: Deploy the model for real-world usage.\n",
        "\n",
